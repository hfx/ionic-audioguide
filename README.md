# ionic-audioguide
An audioguide app with geolocation and media streaming support for the ionic framework

# Howto 
These files will not run standalone, you have to create a new ionic app to make use of them. The interesting code is in www/js/controllers.js and www/js/app.js

# Webserver and JSON
You will need a webserver which serves the media files and handles the JSON requests.
